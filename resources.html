            <h2 class="resources__title">Fire Extinguisher Types and Facts</h2>
            <p class="resources__subtitle">Fires are classified into five (5) classes. They are described below:</p>
            <div class="extinguisher-class">
                <p class="extinguisher-class__title">Class A</p>
                <p class="extinguisher-class__description">A fire extinguisher labeled with letter "A" is for use on
                    Class A fires. Class A fires are fires that involve ordinary combustible materials such as cloth,
                    wood, paper, rubber, and many plastics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="extinguisher-class">
                <p class="extinguisher-class__title">Class B</p>
                <p class="extinguisher-class__description">A fire extinguisher labeled with letter "B" is for use on
                    Class B fires. Class B fires are fires that involve flammable and combustible liquids such as
                    gasoline, alcohol, diesel oil, oil-based paints, lacquers, etc., and flammable gases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="extinguisher-class">
                <p class="extinguisher-class__title">Class C</p>
                <p class="extinguisher-class__description">A fire extinguisher labeled with letter "C" is for use on
                    Class C fires. Class C fires are fires that involve energized electrical equipment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="extinguisher-class">
                <p class="extinguisher-class__title">Class D</p>
                <p class="extinguisher-class__description">A fire extinguisher labeled with letter "D" is for use on
                    Class D fires. Class D fires are fires that involve combustible metals such as magnesium, titanium
                    and sodium.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="extinguisher-class">
                <p class="extinguisher-class__title">Class K</p>
                <p class="extinguisher-class__description">A fire extinguisher labeled with letter "K" is for use on
                    Class K fires. Class K fires are fires that involve vegetable oils, animal oils, or fats in cooking
                    appliances. This is for commercial kitchens, including those found in restaurants, cafeterias, and
                    caterers.</p>

            <h2 class="resources__title">How do I pick the right type of fire extinguisher?</h2>

            <h2 class="resources__title">How to Use a Fire Extinguisher</h2>
            <p class="resources__description">Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher. The pin releases a locking
                mechanism and will allow you to discharge the extinguisher.</p>
            <p class="resources__description">Aim at the base of the fire, not the flames. This is important - in order
                to put out the fire, you mush extinguish the fuel. </p>
            <p class="resources__description">Squeeze the lever slowly. This will release the the extinguishing agent in
                the extinguisher. If the handle is released, the discharge will stop.</p>
            <p class="resources__description">Sweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire
                extinguisher back and forth until the fire is completely out. Operate the extinguisher from a safe
                distance, several feet away, and then move towards the fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read
                the instructions on your fire extinguisher - different fire extinguishers recommend operating them from
                different distances. Remember: Aim at the base of the fire, not at the flames!!!</p>

        <div class="resources">
            <h2 class="resources__title">UL300 Wet Chemical Systems</h2>
            <p class="resources__description">In November, 1994, Underwriters Laboratories (UL) published UL 300 -- the
                stringent new testing requirements for manufacturers of kitchen hood and duct fire protection systems.
                These requirements were driven by the fact that many restaurant owners had installed new, high
                efficiency burners that heated cooking oils to higher temperatures than in the past, and installed new
                fryers with better insulation that reduced the cooling rate of oils thus keeping them above their
                auto-ignition point for a longer time. The obvious result was more kitchen fires. The new standard for
                testing mandates tougher, more realistic tests for fryers, ranges, griddles, certain types of broilers
                and new woks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="resources">
            <h2 class="resources__title">Kitchen System Manufacturers Comply:</h2>
            <p class="resources__description">The manufacturers of kitchen fire suppression systems were required to
                redesign and re-test all of their systems in order to comply with UL 300s standards. None of the
                existing dry chemical systems could pass the new testing requirements. Most wet chemical systems failed
                as well. Only wet chemical systems with increased flow rates, additional flow points and increased agent
                capacity have been able to meet UL 300 standards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="resources">
            <h2 class="resources__title">What Does This Mean to You?</h2>
            <p class="resources__description">As an owner of a restaurant, you should seriously consider upgrading to
                the new UL 300 standard since your current system(s) most likely do not adequately protect your cooking
                area(s). In addition, area fire marshals have agreed that
                any new system installed after April 1, 1995, must meet the new UL 300 standard which will likely
                require an additional cost for you. Also, any current system(s) to which new appliances have been added
                will require a complete system upgrade to meet the new UL 300 standards.</p>
            <p class="resources__description">New wet chemical systems installed after November 20, 1994, are the only
                systems that are acceptable. If your system was installed prior to November 20, 1994, we strongly
                recommend replacement with a new UL 300 compliant wet chemical kitchen fire suppression system.</p>
            <p class="resources__description">If your kitchen is currently protected by a non-UL 300 compliant fire
                suppression system, ABT would appreciate the opportunity to work with you to install an effective, new
                system that will be complaint with all local fire codes.</p>
